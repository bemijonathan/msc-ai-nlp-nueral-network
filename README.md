## NEURAL SYSTEMS & NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING

#### De Montfort University Leicester (DMU)

While completing my Msc program at DMU I decided to share my entire learning note for people who wish to gain more theoretical knowledge of deep learning and NLP
---

This contains all the lecture notes and  lab works from the De Montfort University for neural networks and NLP classes. 
We used `MATLAB` for neural systems and `Python` for NLP. 

### Objectives (Module Assessments)

- At the end of this Module you will be expected to
 - Understand Neural network architecture.
 - Understand the theoretical basics of NN and Implement new networks
 - Be able to solve supervised and unsupervised learning problems and draw opinions
 - Solve NLP problems using a classical approach with nltk or spacy.
 - Build a generative AI system
 - Implement a robust NLP-based chat system.

### Table of contents

The folder is structured in a way where the lab work notes and research papers studied for that lab is displayed. 
we have 20 lab sessions and 20 classes for the course of this study.
