### Categorizing and tagging words (using nltk)

In Natural Language Processing (NLP), categorization and tagging of words are foundational techniques used to assign predefined labels to words or tokens in a text, helping machines understand and process human language more effectively, It involves

1. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:
POS tagging is the process of labeling each word in a sentence with its corresponding part of speech, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. This helps in understanding the grammatical structure of sentences.
    
    this process involves the use of a tokenizer to break sentences into tokens, and then a tagger that maps the words to a lexical parts of speech

    #### Types of tagger
    | Tagger Type | Context Used | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
    |-------------|--------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
    | Unigram Tagger | Current word only | Assigns the most likely tag for each token based solely on the token itself. | Simple, fast | Doesn't consider surrounding context, less accurate for ambiguous words |
    | Bigram Tagger (2-gram) | Current word and previous tag | Uses the current word and the tag of the previous word to determine the current tag. | More accurate than unigram for many cases | Requires more training data, can suffer from sparse data |
    | Trigram Tagger (3-gram) | Current word and two previous tags | Uses the current word and the tags of the two previous words. | Can capture more complex patterns | Requires even more training data, increased risk of data sparsity |
    | N-gram Tagger | Current word and n-1 previous tags | Generalization of bigram and trigram taggers, can use any number of previous tags. | Flexible, can be optimized for specific tasks | Risk of overfitting with large n, requires substantial training data |
    | Brill Tagger | Surrounding words and tags | Starts with simple tagger and learns correction rules. | Can be more accurate than n-gram taggers, learns interpretable rules | Complex to train, can be slow |
    | Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Tagger | Probabilistic model of tag sequences | Uses probabilities of tag sequences and word-tag associations. | Effective for capturing tag sequence patterns | Requires estimation of many parameters |
    | Maximum Entropy Tagger | Various features including surrounding words and tags | Can incorporate diverse sources of information as features. | Flexible, can include arbitrary features | Can be slow to train, may require feature engineering |
    | Neural Network Tagger (e.g., using PyTorch) | Learned representations of words and context | Uses neural networks to learn complex patterns in data. | Can capture intricate patterns, often achieves state-of-the-art performance | Requires large amounts of data, can be computationally intensive |

    Note: While Unigram, Bigram, Trigram, and N-gram taggers are explicitly available in NLTK, more advanced taggers like neural network-based ones might require additional libraries or custom implementation.


2. Named Entity Recognition (NER) :NER identifies and categorizes entities like names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and other proper nouns. NER is used in information extraction, knowledge graph creation, and question-answering systems.

3. Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)
SRL identifies the role of different phrases in a sentence in terms of who did what to whom, when, where, and how. This goes beyond POS tagging and looks at the relationships between actions and entities.

    Example: In the sentence, "John threw the ball to Mary," SRL might identify:

    John: Agent (the one performing the action)
    threw: Action (the action being performed)
    the ball: Theme (the thing being acted upon)
    to Mary: Recipient (the one receiving the action)
    Applications: SRL is useful in understanding sentence meanings, improving chatbots, and text summarization.

4. Text Categorization
This involves assigning predefined categories or labels to entire texts, such as classifying emails as spam or not spam, or categorizing news articles into topics (e.g., politics, sports, technology).

    Example: An article might be categorized under "sports" if it discusses football, or "technology" if it reviews the latest smartphone.

    Applications: Text categorization is extensively used in sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and recommendation systems.

5. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
WSD is the process of determining which sense of a word is being used in a sentence, especially when the word has multiple meanings.

    WSD is critical in machine translation, information retrieval, and any application where accurate word meanings are required.
